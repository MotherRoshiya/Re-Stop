RE-STOP INTERACTIVE NOVEL CDN REPOSITORY
This repository is used to provide static images for the Mature rated interactive novel Re-Stop that is currently in development using Twine Harlowe.

Re-Stop is a debut self-taught coding project with the following team members:
Lead Writer/Game Developer: 3PleaAtv
Project Coordinator/Art Director: MotherRoshiya
Systems Specialist: mitchie
Programmer/Technical Lead: tori

WHY WE GAVE IT A MATURE RATING
Using Webtoon's rating survey as a guide, the 6 categories can be described thusly
- VIOLENT AND GRAPHIC CONTENT: There is detailed violence, blood, and gore in battle scenes.
- NUDITY: There is Fan Service and Sexually suggestive scenes.
- SEXUAL CONTENT: There is Sexual Content and sexually suggestive scenes throughout; HOWEVER, we are very big proponents of asking for consent, and not only do the characters ask each other for consent, the choices also ask YOU the player how much detail you want the scene to include, with the option to skip it entirely and just earn the achievement.
- PROFANITY: Uncensored profanity throughout the game, including liberal usage of the expletive "fuck".
- ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, OR DRUGS: There is depiction of moderate to excessive consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and/or drugs, depending on your choices, as well as their consequences.
- SENSITIVE THEMES AND TOPICS: Sensitive themes of familial abuse, torture, being othered, self-harm, rape, substance addiction, self-hatred and acceptance, arson, gender identity, masochism, mercenaries, and healthy relationships through consent are all in the story.
As all of these category choices would have recieved a 3 on Webtoons, we have confidently given our project a Mature Rating.

2. Content Discussion
We love hype and discussions with peers in a fanbase! We ask that you link directly to whatever asset you are discussing, rather than embeding the images elsewhere, unless they are in the list of assets included under Advertisement. If you are introducing the game to your friends for the first time, you MUST mention that it has a MATURE rating.

3. Fan Art
If you fall in love with the character art, signature weapons, and/or anything else in this repository, please feel free to create your own original art of it and share it on social media with the hashtag #ReStopFanArt for us to see!
However, we do ask that any merchandise you create with your own original artwork be limited to PRINTS ONLY. Do NOT use the artwork to create merchandise such as apparel, plushies, homewares, and the like, as we do intend on releasing these sorts of merchandise items after a certain point in production has been achieved.

We have NOT YET decided on an official License Format, and formally request that you limit your use of our assets stored in this repository to ONLY what has been outlined above, and not use any of our assets for commercial use.

FAQs
1. Can I help code Re-Stop?
We would love to have help coding Re-Stop! However, it is also a project to teach ourselves coding with, so we ask for Advice rather than you coding FOR us.

2. Can I Playtest Re-Stop?
If you would like to Playtest Re-Stop, please keep an eye on this repository, as we will create an announcement asset once we are at a point in production where we need Playtesters beyond ourselves, with the appropriate instructions on how to do so.
Please note that due to the Mature Rating, there will inevitably be some means of proving your age is 18+ or that you have permission from a guardian to take part in Playtesting.

3. What languages will be supported by Re-Stop?
All of us are native English speakers in the United States, and therefore we will be launching the project in English Only.

4. Can I help translate the project into another language?
After the successful release of Re-Stop in English, we will be looking for help with translating it into other languages, such as Spanish, Japanese, French, German, and Chinese. Please keep an eye out for an announcement for this if you are interested in helping with that endeavor!

5. Can you make it available in X language?
If you would like Re-Stop to be available in a language other than English after it has been released, you are more than welcome to help us translate it! See "Can I help translate the project into another language?" above.

6. Can you make X merchandise?
When we have reached a certain point in production, we will be looking at merchandise options and will have a way for you to submit your suggestions at that time for consideration. We might say "Yeah! that sounds awesome!" and do it, or we might go "Uh... No... That doesn't sound like a good idea." and deny it, but you'll never know unless you ask for it!

7. Do you have any Social Media accounts I can tag?
We are not an official studio, just a collection of friends, so we do not have social media for the project at this time. However, feel free to use hashtags #ReStop and $ReStopFanArt in your posts!

8. Do you have a Discord Server?
Technically, yes, however we are using it predominantly for game development currently and have not opened it up to the public at this time.

9. Do you have a website?
Website hosting is expensive, and we aren't making any money off of the project at this time, so no, not yet.

10. Do you have a Ko-fi or Patreon?
If you would like to support us financially, MotherRoshiya has a personal ko-fi that you can donate to at https://ko-fi.com/motherroshiya and if you include "For Re-Stop" as part of the donation message, she will make sure to use it for project expenses and split the profits with the team.

11. I have a question that hasn't been answered; how do I ask you it?
If you have a question that hasn't been answered, use hashtag #ReStopFAQ in social media posts, and when we see it, we'll consider either directly responding or adding it here.
